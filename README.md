## OrbisWPS : Open-source Web Processing Service (WPS) libraries.


OrbisWPS contains a set of libraries to build a Web Processing Service [(WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) compliant with the 2.0 specification.
OrbisWPS is developed by GIS team of the  [Lab-STICC](http://www.lab-sticc.fr/en/index/) laboratory, located in Vannes.
It has been supported by two research projects:

- [MapUCE](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?Projet=ANR-13-VBDU-0004) (Modeling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy, 2014-2018),  ANR Programme: Villes et BÃ¢timents Durables (VBD) 2013

- [ENERGIC-OD](https://www.energic-od.eu/) Project (European Network for Redistributing Geospatial Information to user Communities - Open Data; 2014-2017) partially funded under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme by the European Community and the French geographic portal GEOPAL of the Pays de la Loire region.
