/**
 * Main class of the plugin which declares the scripts to add, their locations in the process tree and the icons
 * associated.
 * In the WpsService, the script are organized in a tree, which has the WpsService as root.
 *
 * Scripts can be add to the tree under a specific node path with custom icon with the following method :
 *      localWpsService.addLocalScript('processFile', 'icon', 'boolean', 'nodePath');
 * with the following parameter :
 *      processFile : The File object corresponding to the script. Be careful, the plugin resource files can't be
 *              accessed from the outside of the plugin. So you have to copy it (in a temporary file as example) before
 *              adding it to the WpsService.
 *      icon : Array of Icon object to use for the WpsClient tree containing the processes. The first icon will be used
 *              for the first node of the path, the second icon for the second node ... If the node already exists,
 *              its icon won't be changed. If there is less icon than node, the last icon will be used for the others.
 *              If no icon are specified, the default one from the WpsClient will be used.
 *      boolean : it SHOULD be true. Else the used will be able to remove the process from the WpsClient without
 *              deactivating the plugin.
 *      nodePath : Path to the node where the process should be add. If nodes of the path doesn't exists, they will be
 *              created.
 * This add method return a ProcessIdentifier object which give all the information needed to identify a process. It
 * should be kept to be able to remove it later.
 *
 *
 * There is two method already implemented in this class to add the processes :
 *      Default method : the 'defaultLoadScript('nodePath')' methods which take as argument the nodePath and adds all
 *              the scripts from the 'resources' folder, keeping the file tree structure. All the script have the same
 *              icons.
 *      Custom method : the 'customLoadScript()' method load the scripts one by one under different file path with
 *              different icons.
 *
 *
 * When the plugin is launched , the 'activate()' method is call. This method load the scripts in the
 * WpsService and refresh the WpsClient.
 * When the plugin is stopped or uninstalled, the 'deactivate()' method is called. This method removes the loaded script
 * from the WpsService and refreshes the WpsClient.
